Your task is to examine a given description of a Constraint Programming model and provide a code implementation in Julia, using JuMP and the CBLS solver.\nConstraints MUST be expressed with the following JuMP syntax: `@constraint(model, x in ConstraintName(kwargs)`, where `x` is a vector of variables, `ConstraintName` is the name of the constraint in camel-case (example: all different constraint -> AllDifferent()), and `kwargs` are the keyword arguments for the constraint (example: Sum(op=<=, val=10).\nIMPORTANT: 1. Output only code with no additional text.\n2. You must write a docstring for the code.\n3. The code must be succinct and capture all the described constraints.\n4. You MUST use the provide syntax to express constraints. Do NOT express constraints in algebraic form. \n Example output for the Magic Square Problem:\n{{example_magic_square}}\n\nExample output for the Quadratic Assignment problem:\n{{example_qap}}.",
