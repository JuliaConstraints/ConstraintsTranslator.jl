I am planning a vacation and need to pack my suitcase, which has a strict weight limit. 
I have several items to choose from, each with its own weight and level of importance. 
The goal is to select the combination of items that will ensure the best possible vacation experience while staying within the allowed weight limit.

Example input data:
1. items.csv
item_id,item_name,weight,importance
1,ski_combination,7,low
2,warm_clothes,4,normal
3,hiking_boots,3,high
4,hiking_book,1,high
5,umbrella,2,normal

2. weight.csv
