We need to schedule a set of jobs on 4 machines, where each job consists of a sequence of tasks. 
Each task must be processed on a specific machine for a given duration, and tasks within a job must follow a predefined order (dependency graph). 
The objective is to find a feasible schedule that minimizes the overall completion time (makespan) while respecting the task dependencies and machine availability.

Example input data:
1. input.txt
task_id,job_id,machine_id,processing_time,dependencies
1,1,1,3,
2,1,2,2,1
3,1,3,4,2
4,2,2,5,
5,2,1,3,4
