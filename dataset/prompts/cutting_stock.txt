We have a paper roll manufacturing company that produces standard rolls of paper, all of the same width but with a fixed length of 100 meters. 
The company receives orders from customers for smaller rolls of different lengths. 
Our task is to determine how to cut the standard rolls to fulfill these orders while minimizing the number of standard rolls used.
