We aim to solve a Set Covering problem where a set of locations needs to be covered by selecting the minimum number of available sets.
The objective is to minimize the number of selected sets while ensuring that every location is covered by at least one selected set.
Example input data:

1. sets.csv
set_id,cost

2,5
3,2
4,4

2. coverage.csv
set_id,location_id
