You are tasked with creating a seating arrangement for a wedding reception. 
The reception will be held in a venue with round tables, each seating 8 people.
The bride and groom must be seated at the same table (Table 1).
Immediate family members of the bride and groom must be seated at Tables 1 and 2.
Couples must be seated together.
People with known conflicts (e.g., divorced couples, family feuds) must be seated at different tables.
Maximize the number of guests seated with others they know, and seat guests with similar interests together when possible.
