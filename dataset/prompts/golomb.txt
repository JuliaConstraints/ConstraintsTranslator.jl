We need to find a feasible Golomb ruler of a specified length m and order n.
A Golomb ruler is a set of n marks placed along a ruler such that all pairwise distances between marks are distinct. 
The goal is to determine the positions of the marks that satisfy the distinct distance condition for the given length.
