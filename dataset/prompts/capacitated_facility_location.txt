We aim to solve a Capacitated Facility Location problem where a set of facilities and customers is given.
The objective is to minimize the total cost of opening facilities and serving customers while ensuring that each customer's demand is fully satisfied, and no facility exceeds its capacity.

Example input data:
1. facilities.csv
facility_id,opening_cost,capacity
1,5,15

2. customers.csv
customer_id,demand
1,5

3. transport_cost.csv
facility_id,customer_id,cost
1,1,3
