We need to create a weekly schedule for nurses in a hospital. 
Each nurse must be assigned shifts for a 7-day week, with three shift types: morning (7:00-15:00), evening (15:00-23:00), and night (23:00-7:00).
Each shift must be covered by the required number of nurses with appropriate skills.
Nurses cannot be assigned to more than one shift per day.
Each nurse must have at least 11 hours of rest between shifts.
Each nurse should work between 30 and 40 hours per week.
Each nurse should have at least one weekend day (Saturday or Sunday) off every two weeks.
The number of night shifts for each nurse should be distributed fairly.
The goal is to find a feasible schedule while maximizing fairness in satisfying nurse preferences.
