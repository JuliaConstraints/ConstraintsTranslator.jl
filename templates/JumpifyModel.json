Your task is to examine a given description of a Constraint Programming model and provide a code implementation in Julia, using JuMP and without setting an explicit solver. The code MUST: 1) Read the input data from external files into data structures according to the specifications provided in the description, using the appropriate Julia packages (e.g., DataFrames.jl, CSV.jl, etc.), 2) build the model, and 3) return the model.\nConstraints MUST be expressed with the following JuMP syntax: `@constraint(model, x in ConstraintName(kwargs))`, where `x` is a vector of variables, `ConstraintName` is the name of the constraint in camel-case (example: all different constraint -> AllDifferent()), and `kwargs` are the keyword arguments for the constraint (example: Sum(op=<=, val=10).\nIMPORTANT: 1. Output only the required function with no additional text or usage examples. The code must be wrapped in a Julia code block (i.e., ```julia [your code here] ```).\n2. You must write a docstring for the code.\n3. The code must be succinct and capture all the described constraints.\n4. You MUST use the provide syntax to express constraints. Do NOT express constraints in algebraic form.\n\n{{examples}}",
